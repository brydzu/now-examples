# Preact

In this example we will be deploying preact default template with all features using preact-cli.

### Getting started with Preact

- Start a new Preact project:

```
npx preact create default <project name> --yarn
```

### Deploy with Now

First we need to create a `now.json` configuration file to instruct Now how to build the project.

For this example we will be using our newest version [Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/now).

By adding the `version` key to the `now.json` file, we can specify which Now Platform version to use.

We also need to define each builders we would like to use. [Builders](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/) are modules that take a deployment's source and return an output, consisting of [either static files or dynamic Lambdas](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builds/#sources-and-outputs).

Then we need to add a `now.json` file to specify we want to use our Platform V2.

In this case we are going to use `@now/static-build` to build and deploy our Preact application selecting the `package.json` as our entry point. We will also define a name for our project (optional).

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"name": "my-preact-app",
	"builds": [
		{
			"src": "package.json",
			"use": "@now/static-build",
			"config": { "distDir": "build" }
		}
	],
	"routes": [
		{ "src": "^/assets/(.*)", "dest": "/assets/$1" },
		{
			"src": "^/(.*)\\.(.*)\\.(js|css|json|css.map|js.map)$",
			"headers": { "cache-control": "Immutable" },
			"dest": "/$1.$2.$3"
		},
		{ "src": "^/(.*)\\.(js|css|json|css.map|js.map)$", "dest": "/$1.$2" },
		{ "src": "^/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
	]
}
```

Visit our [documentation](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) for more information on the `now.json` configuration file.

We also need to include a script in `package.json` named `"now-build"` that specifies what command Now will run on the server to "build" your application. By default, preact-cli will output the build to the `build` directory, which is configured in the above `now.json` file.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "now-build": "npm run build"
    }
}
```

We are now ready to deploy the app.

```

```

## CLI Commands

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy
npm run test
```
